# Heart Attack Predictor
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart attacks using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning pipelines. It employs various preprocessing techniques and classification models to achieve reliable predictions.

##Features
-EDA and Visualization: Analyzes and visualizes key trends in the data.

-Data Preprocessing: Includes scaling, encoding, and handling of categorical variables.

-Modeling: Utilizes a range of classifiers such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Ensemble Voting Classifiers.

-Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using metrics like F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these using:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Use
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Open the notebook HeartAttackPredictor.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Execute the cells in sequence to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales numeric features, and encodes categorical features.
Model Training: Trains and tunes models using pipelines.
Evaluation: Analyzes model performance using cross-validation and test sets.
Results
The notebook demonstrates effective preprocessing and classification to predict heart attack risks based on input data. Detailed visualizations and metrics provide insights into the models' performance.
